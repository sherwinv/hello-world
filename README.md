First program attempt - JAN2017

Hi, this is my first venture in the world of programming.  I'm here to pursue not just a new beginning but a new career.  I can't say that I have not liked what I've done in the past 20 years of my life, but I feel that I could have always have done better but did not have much time to make the change.  Now that I have made a move, I am motivated to head in a new direction.
